# vgg-f-tensorflow
  tensorflow doesn't provide the pretrained network.It is not convenient for us.
  
  This code implements vgg-f in tensorflow . you can learn from it and construct your network.
  
  I exploit old imagenet-vgg-f.mat version to implement,and i couldn't find it in matconvnet official website.you can download the corresponding version from this link.http://pan.baidu.com/s/1hs7It9a
  
  If you have some problem or my code have some problem,welcome to contact to me.
